# car-project-esp8266-
I don't have the car right now; I broke it down for other projects. Let me know if you want me to rebuild it again. Anyway, the code works fine. I might add additional components, such as a joystick, radio receiver, or atomizer, to simulate exhaust.
This project was made using Platform.io on VSCode with the libraries mentioned in the code if you want to try it out for yourself
